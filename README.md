Dijs
----

Dijs is a small dependency injection module for Node.js and browser environments. It was inspired
by [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org/), includes rudimentary namespace support and lazy
dependency resolution.

Dependency injection might be a useful pattern to organize larger projects. As injection happens
only once to compose a namespace, there shouldn't be drawbacks in performance.

# Usage
In addition, please refer to the tests in the spec/ folder.

````js

  function Price (value, currency) {
    return {
      value : value,
      currency : currency,
      valueOf : function () {
        return value;
      },
      toString : function () {
        return this.value + ' ' + this.currency;
      }
    };
  }

  function Shelf (price) {
    var items = [];

    items.totalSum = function () {
      var sum = 0;
      for (var item, i = 0, l = items.length; i < l; ++i) {
        sum += items[i].price;
      }
      return sum;
    };

    items.addBook = function (id, value, currency) {
      items.push({
        id : id,
        price : price(value, currency)
      });
    };

    return items;
  }

  var mod = Di();
  mod.provide('price', Price, true);
  mod.provide('store.shelf', Shelf);
  mod.provide('store.address', { street : 'Plan 7' }, true);
  mod.store.shelf.addBook('1984', 3,'Euro');
  mod.store.shelf.addBook('Lord of the rings', 30,'Euro');
  mod.store.shelf.addBook('Modernist cuisine', 55,'Euro');
  assert.equal(mod.store.shelf.length, 3);

  // Total value 88
  console.log('Total value', mod.store.shelf.totalSum());

# Reference

## Di (moduleId, lazy)

Creates a new namespace. The module id serves as optional prefix for sub-modules.

In lazy mode, resolve() must be called manually to resolve the dependency graph. This might be
useful for application initialization, as the order of provided modules is irrelevant in this case.

## Di.provide(id, object, passthrough)

Provides a module in the namespace under the supplied id. If passthrough is true, the object will
be just passed through, no dependencies are looked up this way.

Sub-modules can be provided with the dot delimiter:

````js
var mod = Di();
mod.provide('module.submodule.value', 1, true);

// { submodule : { value : 1 } }
console.log(mod.get('module'));
````

If you don't pass a value through, you can choose between the function and the array notation to
describe the module's dependencies. In any case, you will need to pass a function whose return value
gets stores in the namespace. Its parameters describe its dependencies.

### function notation

Each function parameter represents a dependency.
Note that you cannot inject dot-delimited dependencies with this notation.

````js
var mod = Di();
mod.provide('Pi',Math.PI, true);
mod.provide('2Pi', function (Pi) { return 2*Pi; });
````

### array notation

A module is represented as array with uneven length. Dependencies are represented by strings, the
actual module function must be the last value of the array.
You can also inject dot-delimited dependencies and use different variable names for dependencies
with this notation.

````js
var mod = Di();
mod.provide('Math.Pi',Math.PI, true);
mod.provide('2Pi', ['Math.Pi', function (Pi) {
  return function () {
    return 2*Pi;
  };
}]);
````

## Di.inject(fn)

Resolves all dependencies of the supplied function or array and calls the function.
No modification of the namespace takes place.

## Di.run(fn, args...)

Resolves all dependencies of the supplied function or array, calls the function with the supplied
arguments and _returns its return value_. No modification of the namespace takes place.

## Di.get(id)

Returns the (previously declared) module specified by id.

## Di.resolve()

Resolves the dependency graph. This function gets called internally when lazy dependency resolution
is turned off, but it must be called if the namespace is initialized in lazy mode.

All subsequent calls to provide/inject and run will resolve the dependency graph immediately.

````js
var mod = Di('namespace', true);
mod.provide('2Pi', ['Math.Pi', 'Log', function (Pi, Log) {
  return function () {
    Log(2*Pi);
  }
}]);
mod.provide('Math.Pi',Math.PI, true);
mod.provide('Log',console.log.bind(console), true);
mod.resolve();

# Testing

To install all Node.js dependencies and run the unit tests, execute the following commands:
````
$ npm install
$ grunt mocha
````

# Build
A minified version (1916 bytes, 911 bytes gzipped) is included in the build/ directory.

In addition, you can create a minified build with Google's Closure compiler by yourself.

Please refer to gmarty's [grunt-closure-compiler](https://github.com/gmarty/grunt-closure-compiler)
for further information about installation of this requirement.

After installation, execute:

````
$ grunt minify
